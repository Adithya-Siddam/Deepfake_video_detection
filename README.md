# Deepfake video and Image detection using Vision transformers and contrastive learning
## Introduction
Deepfake technology has rapidly advanced, making it increasingly challenging to differentiate
between real and manipulated media.
This project focuses on detecting deepfake videos using advanced machine learning techniques
and video analysis.

## Features:
- Detection of face manipulation in videos.
- Uses pre-trained models for feature extraction and classification.
- Capable of analyzing frame-by-frame inconsistencies.
- User-friendly interface for uploading and evaluating videos.
## Technologies Used:
- Python for backend processing.
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning model development.
- OpenCV for video preprocessing and frame extraction.
- Django for web-based interface (if applicable).

  ## Usage:
- Upload a video file through the interface.
- The application will process the video and provide a deepfake detection report.
- View results and download the report if necessary.
 ## Results and Accuracy:
- The model achieves high accuracy on test datasets with a precision of 93.5% and recall of 92.8%.
- Handles multiple video formats and resolutions effectively.
